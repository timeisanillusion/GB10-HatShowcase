## 🤔 Ideas for Enhancement

### 1. Responsiveness / Mobile Support
- ❓ Does the 3-column layout (sidebar + content + stats) work on tablets/phones?
- ❓ Is the 2-column settings modal responsive?

### 2. Accessibility (a11y)
- ⚠️ Missing ARIA labels for icon buttons
- ⚠️ No keyboard shortcuts (e.g., Esc to close settings, Space to start/stop)
- ⚠️ Focus trap in modal?
- ⚠️ Screen reader announcements for dynamic content (VLM results)?

### 3. Error Handling & Empty States
- ❓ What if API connection fails? Is there a helpful error message?
- ❓ What if camera permission is denied?
- ❓ Empty state before starting camera?
- ❓ Model loading failures?

### 4. Loading States
- ❓ Loading indicator when VLM is processing?
- ❓ Button loading states (spinning icon)?
- ❓ Skeleton loaders for stats before data arrives?

### 5. User Feedback & Confirmations
- ❓ Toast notifications for settings saved, model changed, etc.?
- ❓ Confirm before changing model mid-analysis?

### 6. Results Management
- ⚠️ No way to copy VLM output to clipboard
- ⚠️ No way to save/export results history
- ⚠️ No timestamp on VLM outputs
- ⚠️ No history/log of previous results

### 7. Performance & Metrics
- ✅ Latency metrics exist
- ❓ Could add FPS counter for camera feed
- ❓ Network status indicator (WebSocket health)
- ❓ Token usage tracking (especially for paid APIs)

### 8. Video Controls
- ✅ Mirror button exists
- ❓ Could add: Zoom controls, Pan/Tilt (for PTZ cameras)
- ❓ Snapshot button to capture current frame
- ❓ Fullscreen mode for video

### 9. Keyboard Shortcuts
- ⚠️ No shortcuts
- Could add:
  - `Space` = Start/Stop analysis
  - `Esc` = Close modal
  - `Ctrl+S` = Open settings
  - `Ctrl+C` = Copy VLM result
  - `M` = Mirror video

### 10. Help & Documentation
- ❓ No "Help" button or tooltips explaining features
- ❓ No onboarding for first-time users
- ❓ No changelog/version info

### 11. Visual Enhancements
- ❓ Transitions/Animations when VLM result updates (fade in/out?)
- ❓ Highlight changed text in result (if incrementally updating)
- ❓ Status icons for API/camera/model health

### 12. Advanced Features (Additional Logic / Features)
- ❓ Compare mode: Split screen with 2 models side-by-side
- ❓ Batch processing: Upload images instead of camera
- ❓ Recording: Save video + VLM annotations
